    "Below happens to be a throwback project of mine. I remember when I made this code, it happened to be my first time fiddling around with tkinter. The reason why I wanted to import tkinter in a project like this, was because I wanted to add gui's to my projects which would give it that \"extra spice.\" In terms of what this project does, it is a dice roller. There are buttons presented when you run the program within a graphical user interface, and each time you click roll dice, a combination of two numbers being added is presented within your terminal. Overall, I did learn a lot about guis and keeping windows open when creating a game, that was one good takeaway from this project. "
